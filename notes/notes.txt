Introns across SRA may be found at both
  /scratch0/langmead-fs1/sraintrons on HHPC and
  /dcl01/leek/data/sraintrons on JHPCE

File descriptions:

all_SRA_introns.tsv.gz:
  column 1: chromosome
  column 2: start position (1-based, inclusive)
  column 3: end position (1-based, inclusive)
  column 4: strand
  column 5: left motif (e.g., GT)
  column 6: right motif (e.g., AG)
  column 7: comma-separated list of indexes of samples in which intron was detected in order of
  increasing sample index
  column 8: comma-separated list of numbers of reads in which intron was found in corresponding samples from column 7
